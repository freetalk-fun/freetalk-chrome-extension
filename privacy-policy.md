# Privacy Policy for The FreeTalk Chrome Extension (FTX)

**Effective Date:** October 18, 2025

FreeTalk.fun values your privacy. This extension interacts with the FreeTalk Dictionary API (`https://dictionary.freetalk.fun`) only to fetch word definitions and meanings. It does **not** collect, store, or share any personal or identifiable information.

---

## What Data Is Collected

When the extension makes a dictionary lookup (GET request), standard **technical request logs** are automatically generated by AWS infrastructure (API Gateway, CloudFront). These logs may include:

- The **word** you search for (`term` in the query)
- **IP address** (for rate limiting and abuse prevention)
- **Timestamp**
- **HTTP method and response status**
- **Browser/extension User-Agent**
- **Latency and response size**

No names, emails, authentication tokens, or other identifiers are collected.

---

## How This Data Is Used

- To **serve definitions** and operate the service
- To **protect the API** from abuse (rate limiting, security filtering)
- To **monitor uptime and performance**
- To generate **aggregate, anonymous usage metrics**

All logs are ephemeral and retained only for short operational periods (typically 30–90 days).

---

## What’s Not Collected or Stored

- No personal data  
- No cookies or local storage  
- No analytics tracking or ad identifiers  
- No information shared with third parties  

---

## Permissions

This extension:
- Uses **no special permissions** beyond standard Chrome installation requirements.
- Accesses only the FreeTalk Dictionary API to retrieve word data.
- Runs entirely client-side — no background data collection occurs.

---

## Future Updates

Future versions may introduce optional features (e.g., saved history or user accounts). If that happens, this policy will be updated to clearly describe the changes before release.
